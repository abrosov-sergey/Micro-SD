Ensuring high data quality and availability is crucial for applications operating within our framework. This framework utilizes “data modules,” which are stored either on Amazon S3 or in a relational database management system (RDBMS). Each data module is defined by metadata compatible with JSON-LD, a collection protocol, and versioned data.   
The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) service is designed to pull data from internal corporate systems, perform extensive cleansing, merging, anonymization, and transformation of the data, and subsequently upload it to create a new version of the data module. These processed data modules are then readily available for use by machine learning applications deployed within the framework.

- Project Managers   
   
   
## Features    
   
**Multistage Data Cleansing**: Capabilities for removing duplicates, correcting errors, normalizing data, and performing other data cleansing stages.   
**Data Anonymization and Masking**: Tools for removing or replacing personally identifiable information to protect privacy.   
**Data Merging**: Ability to combine data from multiple sources, resolve conflicts, and ensure consistency.   
**Data Transformation**: Transforming data into required formats and structures, including aggregation, filtering, and calculations.   
**Data Versioning**: Support for versioning data to track changes and enable rollback to previous versions.   
**Metadata and Protocol Management**: Storing and managing metadata compatible with json-ld, and adhering to data collection protocols for improved data understanding and usage.   
**Integration with Cloud and Relational Storage**: Support for various data storage systems, including Amazon S3 and relational databases (RDBMS), for data storage and management.   
**Monitoring and Reporting**: Tools for monitoring ETL process execution, and generating reports on process status, data quality, and performance.   
**Compatibility**: The ETL service must be compatible with various data sources (databases, cloud storage, files) and support multiple data formats (JSON, CSV).   
   
## Constrains   

1. Scalability   
The system should support both horizontal and vertical scaling to handle increasing data volumes and the number of data sources.
  
2. Reliability   
The ETL service should have a high level of availability (e.g., 99.9%) and be able to continue operating or gracefully complete current operations in the event of failures.
  
3. Security   
The system must ensure data protection at all stages (extraction, transformation, loading), including authentication, authorization, data encryption, and access auditing.

4. Disaster Recovery   
The ETL service must support automatic recovery after failures, including the ability to resume operations from the last successful operation or checkpoint.

5. Maintainability   
The system should be easy to maintain and update. Updates and patches should be deployable without significant downtime or the need for a complete system restart.

6. Usability   
The system interface should be intuitive for users with different technical backgrounds. It should offer tools for visual configuration and monitoring of ETL processes.

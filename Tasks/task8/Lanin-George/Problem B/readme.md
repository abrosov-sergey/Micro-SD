# Eight Queens Puzzle Solution

The solution contains "Abstract Data Type" method implementation for "Eight Queens" problem.

To execute just enter the command "python solution.py".

Unfortunately, I have no time to compare my solution with my teamates, but it works pretty fast. There are no ambigous entities, I separated only Board for coordinations management. There also no ambigous callbacs, events. I like this solution.

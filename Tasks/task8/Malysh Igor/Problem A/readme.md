# Key Word in Context (KWIC) Solution

This project implements a Key Word in Context (KWIC) index generator using modularization principles inspired by David Parnasâ€™ approach to decomposing systems into modules. The program processes lines of text, generates all circular shifts of each line (with stop word filtering), sorts these shifts alphabetically, and displays a KWIC index.

## Modules

The solution is divided into five modules:<br/>

1. **Input**: Reads and stores lines of text.<br/>
2. **Circular Shift**: Generates all circular shifts for each line, excluding those that start with specified stop words.<br/>
3. **Alphabetizing**: Sorts the circular shifts alphabetically.<br/>
4. **Output**: Displays the KWIC index in alphabetical order.<br/>
5. **Master Control**: Coordinates the execution of all other modules.

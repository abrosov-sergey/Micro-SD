# Key Word in Context (KWIC) Solution

This project implements a Key Word in Context (KWIC) index generator using modularization principles described in David Parnasâ€™ paper, On the Criteria To Be Used in Decomposing Systems into Modules. The program takes lines of text, generates all circular shifts of each line, sorts these shifts alphabetically, and displays a KWIC index.

## Modules

The solution is divided into five modules:

1.	Input Module: Reads and stores lines of text.
2.	Circular Shift Module: Generates all circular shifts for each line.
3.	Alphabetizing Module: Sorts circular shifts alphabetically.
4.	Output Module: Formats and displays the KWIC index.
4.5 A little module for stop word filteration. Not required, but I think its better to add for real life implementation.
5.	Master Control Module: Coordinates the execution of other modules.

## Getting Started

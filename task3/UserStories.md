1. CLEANSING DATA:

Imputing Missing Values Using Mean Imputation

As an MLOps Engineer,I want the system to automatically replace missing numeric values with the mean of the available data,so that I can ensure my machine learning models are trained on complete datasets without introducing biases caused by missing values.

Scenario:An MLOps Engineer is preparing data for model training but notices several missing values in a numeric field, such as "age" or "income". The ETL service automatically calculates the mean of the non-missing values and imputes this mean into the missing entries. The engineer proceeds with training the ML model on the complete dataset without risking model degradation due to missing data.

Flagging and Removing Outliers in Data for ML training

As a Data Scientist,I want the system to detect and flag outliers based on statistical methods like Z-score or IQR,so that I can choose to remove or handle them before training my machine learning models to avoid skewed results.

Scenario:A Data Scientist is working with a large dataset containing numeric fields like "transaction amounts". The ETL system identifies extreme outliers using Z-score analysis, flags them, and suggests removal or correction. The scientist reviews the flagged records and decides whether to remove them or adjust them, ensuring the training data is robust and free of anomalies.

Correcting Inconsistent Feature Scales for ML training

As a Data Scientist,I want the system to automatically normalize or standardize feature values across the dataset,so that my machine learning algorithms perform optimally without being biased by scale differences in the input data.

Scenario:A Data Scientist is preparing a dataset for a machine learning model that requires features to be on a similar scale (e.g., logistic regression or neural networks). The ETL service detects that some features are on different scales (e.g., "age" ranges from 0-100, while "income" ranges from 0-100,000) and normalizes or standardizes these features. This preprocessing step ensures that the model doesn't give undue importance to features based on their scale.

Fixing Inconsistent Casing in Text Fields for ML training

As an MLOps Engineer,I want to correct inconsistencies in text casing,so that I can avoid errors when performing text analysis and ensure uniformity in text data.

Scenario:An MLOps Engineer encounters a dataset where customer reviews are written with inconsistent casing (e.g., "great product" vs. "GREAT PRODUCT"). The ETL service automatically corrects these inconsistencies by normalizing the text to lower case with proper capitalization where needed. This helps ensure that downstream NLP models perform well with consistent input.

Automatically Handling Categorical Variables for ML Training

As an MLOps Engineer,I want the system to automatically encode categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding,so that I can directly use the processed data for machine learning model training without manual intervention.

Scenario:An MLOps Engineer is preparing a dataset containing categorical features like "city" or "product type". The ETL service identifies these categorical fields and automatically applies one-hot encoding or label encoding, depending on the use case. The processed dataset is then ready for input into machine learning models, reducing the need for manual data preprocessing.

2. Log﻿ging and Audit Trails

Tracking Data Transformations for Model Reproducibility

Name: Logging Data Transformations for Model ReproducibilityAs a Data Scientist,I want the ETL service to log all data transformations applied to the dataset,So that I can ensure my machine learning models are reproducible by using the exact same dataset transformations when retraining models in the future.

Scenario:After a dataset undergoes a series of cleansing, merging, and transformation steps, the Data Scientist uses the logs to retrieve details on every transformation applied, such as normalization methods or data imputation strategies. When retraining or tuning a machine learning model, the Data Scientist can refer to these logs to ensure the dataset used remains consistent, enabling reproducibility of the model’s results.

Viewing Historical Logs of Data Merging and Transformation

Name: Viewing Historical Logs for Data Merging and TransformationAs a Data Engineer,I want the ETL service to allow me to view the full historical log of all data transformations and merges applied to a specific data module,So that I can perform in-depth analyses on how the data has evolved over time and identify any potential errors or inconsistencies in the process.

Scenario:After completing several iterations of data processing, the Data Engineer accesses the historical logs to review the transformation steps applied during previous ETL runs. They can see a step-by-step breakdown of each data cleansing, merging, and anonymization process, along with detailed information about any user interventions or system-applied corrections. This helps them track the evolution of the dataset and catch any potential issues that might have been introduced in earlier stages.

Searchable Logs for Fast Debugging of Data Pipeline Issues

Name: Searchable Logs for Rapid Issue Resolution in Data PipelinesAs a Data Engineer,I want the ETL service to provide searchable logs of all data processing steps,So that I can quickly filter and locate specific transformations or user actions that might be causing issues in the data pipeline,Thereby enabling me to debug and resolve issues faster.

Scenario:When the ETL pipeline fails or produces unexpected results in the output data, the Data Engineer can use the searchable logs to filter by specific actions (e.g., filtering only actions related to data normalization). This enables them to quickly identify the point of failure or deviation, assess the problem, and take corrective actions without needing to manually sift through the entire log history.

Auditing Data Pipeline Changes

Name: Monitoring Pipeline Modifications through Audit LogsAs a MLOps Engineer,I want the system to maintain audit logs for any changes made to the data pipeline,So that I can ensure that updates to data flows, configuration settings, or scripts are traceable and can be reverted if necessary.

Scenario:During a deployment, the MLOps Engineer updates the configuration of the data pipeline to accommodate a new data source. The system records this change in the audit log, noting who made the update, when it was made, and what specific configurations were altered. This audit log allows the Engineer to track all pipeline modifications and ensures that any issues caused by the update can be traced back to the exact change, allowing for quick resolution.

Investigating Data Quality Issues Using Logs

Name: Using Logs to Investigate Data Quality IssuesAs a Data Engineer,I want to be able to trace back any data quality issues through detailed transformation logs,So that I can identify the root cause of data discrepancies and correct them.

Scenario:After noticing discrepancies in the dataset during model training, the Data Engineer uses the transformation logs to investigate the issue. By reviewing each processing step logged in the system, the Engineer identifies a specific transformation that introduced the error and takes corrective action to resolve the issue. This ability to track and investigate data transformations ensures that data quality is maintained throughout the pipeline.
